## About

Welcome to the Naptown Roller Girls … and to the women of Indianapolis roller derby. We are a league made up of great skaters, volunteers, referees, sponsors, fans, and friends who have all devoted their time, talents, energy, and efforts to help bring flat-track roller derby to the Circle City—and we’re not talking about roller derby of old. Forget the fights and flash. What we wish to introduce to you is about athleticism and skill—it’s the coolest sport there ever was for women.

NRG is different; as skaters, we are competitive women who work to unlock our athletic potential. We are willing to push ourselves physically, willing to give altruistically to the betterment of the league, and willing to show a level of commitment and maturity to accept that the NRG experience will change our lives for the better. We believe, with conviction, that being part of NRG is one of the most meaningful experiences of our lives.

Formed in 2006, The Naptown Roller Girls is one of more than 200 flat- and banked-track roller derby leagues around the country. The ladies of our competing teams, the veteran Tornado Sirens and the junior-varsity Warning Belles, as well as our team of newbies, The Third Alarm, have collected bruises, torn tendons, dislocated ankles and broken bones to bring roller derby in all its grit and glory to the Indianapolis area.

NRG is a member of the [Women’s Flat Track Derby Association](http://wftda.com/), which is a national governing body for women’s amateur flat-track roller derby in the U.S. As a member of WFTDA, NRG is among the ranks of more than 100 all-female, skater-owned and -operated leagues nationwide that have united to lead the growing sport. WFTDA member leagues engage in sanctioned inter-league play, including regional playoffs and a championship tournament.

For more information on being a part of Naptown Roller Girls, contact us through email at [freshmeat@naptownrollergirls.com](mailto:freshmeat@naptownrollergirls.com). We hold tryouts every 3 – 6 months based on interest.
